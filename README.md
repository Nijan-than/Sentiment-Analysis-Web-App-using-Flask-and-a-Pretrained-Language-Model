# Sentiment-Analysis-Web-App-using-Flask-and-a-Pretrained-Language-Model.

Web Framework: Flask

Pre Trained Language model: Sentence Transformer or Transformer

My idea is to develop a Flask application using a microservice architecture for sentiment analysis of YouTube comments. The application will leverage a sentence transformer to analyze the sentiment of comments, categorizing them as positive, negative, or neutral. This analysis will provide valuable insights into current trends and audience preferences.

The results will be stored in a CSV file, including fields such as email ID (or YouTube ID) and the sentiment analysis outcome. This structured log of sentiment data will facilitate easier tracking and evaluation of audience feedback, helping to identify emerging trends and needs effectively.
